# ecomm

This e-commerce website is my first SPA created using create-react-app and react-router-dom. 

This app was part of a requirement for the BrainStation web-development course. 
Challenges included having the routes appear to be on separate pages, which I accomplished with a forEach() method.

Todo:
- work on the styling. We had one week to complete each assignment and the styling was rushed.
- add a login which retains saved cart items.

To use the app:

run npm i

nodemon server.js

cd client
  npm start
